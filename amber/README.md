### Converting the AMBER force fields

* Install the appropriate `AmberTools` from `conda-forge`
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge --yes ambertools==20.15
```
* Convert solvent force fields
```bash
python convert_amber.py --input solvents.yaml --log solvents-tests.csv
```
* Convert biopolymer force fields
```bash
python convert_amber.py --input biopolymer.yaml --log biopolymer-tests.csv
```
* Convert GAFF small molecule force fields:
```bash
python convert_amber.py --input gaff.yaml --log gaff-tests.csv
```

With the defaults as set, all you need to do is have the script and the `files/` directory and call `python convert_amber.py`. `-v` or `--no-log` as wanted.

Output:
* `ffxml/` - converted AMBER biopolymer force fields as OpenMM `ffxml`
* `gaff/ffxml` - converted GAFF small molecule force fields as OpenMM `ffxml`
* `biopolymer-log.csv` - CSV log for biopolymer energy discrepancy tests
* `gaff-tests.csv` - CSV log for GAFF energy discrepancy tests
* (LeAP is called extensively by the script, and outputs its own `leap.log` too)

`-v` will turn on printing of the progress-tracking comments from the script. Warnings issued by ParmEd (warnings are by default filtered to error, but in some cases this had to be relaxed to 'always' because of the nature of the files converted) are printed always. The output of LeAP is always redirected to `dev/null`.

### YAML input format

By default the script takes a YAML file input, `files/master.yaml` has everything that is going on here.
There's only a few rules to the required structure of the YAML and it will be very easily extendable to future forcefields.

First entry in the YAML must be:
```yaml
- sourcePackage: AmberTools
  sourcePackageVersion: 15
```
a MODE declaration follows:
```yaml
- MODE: LEAPRC
```
There are two `MODE`s: `LEAPRC` and `RECIPE`.
* `LEAPRC`: Convert the contents of a `leaprc` file.
* `RECIPE`: Use a mix of `.dat`, `frcmod` and `.lib`, rather than `leaprc`; used for water-ion conversions

`LEAPRC` mode is used for all protein/nucleic acids force fields, e.g.:
```yaml
- Source: leaprc.ff14SB
  Reference:
  - >-
    Maier, J.A., Martinez, C., Kasavajhala, K., Wickstrom, L., Hauser, K.E., and Simmerling, C. (2015).
    ff14SB: Improving the Accuracy of Protein Side Chain and Backbone Parameters from ff99SB. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 11, 3696-3713.
  Test:
  - protein
  - nucleic
```
There's an optional `Options` field which allows changes to parameters if the default must be overridden:
```yaml
- Source: leaprc.phosaa10
  Reference:
  - >-
    Steinbrecher, T., Latzer, J., and Case, D.A. (2012). Revised AMBER parameters for bioorganic phosphates.
    J. Chem. Theory Comput. 8, 4405-4412.
  Options:
    filter_warnings: always
    write_unused: True
  Test:
  - protein_phospho
```
For converting water and ion force fields, the `MODE` is changed to `RECIPE`:
```yaml
- MODE: RECIPE
```
and an extra source package is declared.
Water models are converted manually---we supply them as an ffxml in `files/`.
`tip3p.xml`, `tip4pew.xml`, and `spce.xml` are provided from the OpenMM 7.0, with some changes to make them the 'newest' format (e.g. no classes used, only types).
These `ffxml`s are integrated together with the converted ion parameters to make all the output.
OpenMM 7.0 is therefore listed as the source of these files - hence the extra input.
```yaml
- sourcePackage2: OpenMM
  sourcePackageVersion2: 7.0
```
Here are two examples:
1. A 'standard' file - water model + JC monovalent ions + compromise set +2 ions
```yaml
- Source:
  - parm/frcmod.ionsjc_tip3p
  - parm/frcmod.ionslrcm_cm_tip3p
  - lib/atomic_ions.lib
  Solvent_source: tip3p.xml
  Solvent: tip3p
  Name: tip3p_standard

2. An 'overloading' set: HFE +2, +3 and +4 ions for tip3p water.
```yaml

```

* `Source`: AMBER input files

* `Solvent_source`: the water file in `files/` for the standard (i.e. water model containing) XMLs **or** Standard - this is the same as the `Name` field for the appropriate standard (water model containing) XML - we need to know that, because for the 'overloading' sets both that XML and the standard XML need to be loaded for energy testing

* `Solvent`: this is the name of the solvent, this is necessary to avoid hardcoding of recognition of what solvent you're using from the names of the files etc. - and knowing which solvent you're using is necessary for energy validations.

* `Name`: the desired name of the ffxml. (For proteins and nucleic this is done by the script, which a product of `leaprc.ff14SB` will call `ff14SB.xml` etc.)

Should you want to provide a different YAML (shorter version, different completely, whatever you want), script will take it with:
```bash
python convert_amber.py --input name_of_your_yaml.yaml
```
The outputs of any YAML will be written to `ffxml/`.

You can also provide a `leaprc` of your choosing via:
```bash
python convert_amber.py --input name_of_your_leaprc --input-format leaprc
```
The output of any leaprc will be written to the `./`.

**A few remarks on the water models and ions**

For this conversion:
* water models converted manually using `ffxml` files placed in `files/`, and merged with the appropriate converted ions
* we create *standard* recommended combinations of water and ion models: `tip3p_standard.xml`, `tip4pew_standard.xml`, `spce_standard.xml`: water model + JC monovalent ions + compromise set +2 ions
* for each water model, we have an HFE and IOD set for multivalent ions; all have templates set to `overload = "1"`. (`tip3p_HFE_multivalent.xml`, `tip3p_IOD_multivalent.xml` etc.)
* usage is to always load in a standard, and then you can overload +2's and add +3 and +4 with the HFE or IOD files
* naming of the water atom types remains as before (`tip3p-O`)
* naming of the ion atom types is `name_of_set (dash) amber_atom_type_name`, e.g. `tip3p_standard-Na+`, `tip3p_HFE_multivalent-Zn2+`.

**Tests**

Run `test/test.py` with `nosetests`.
